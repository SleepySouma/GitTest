# GitTest

This one's for MIOLA Students, who are here for the practical workshop:
- Clone this project on your desktop app
- Go to the ContributorsList branch
- Make these changes locally on your text editor:
  * Add your name on the index.html file under the contributors list
  * Make a simple change to either the javascript or css files
- Try to directly push those changes or make a pull request (error: you dont have the writing rights)
- Now choose the "fork this repository" option from the error message
- Then submit a Pull Request
- I will accept as many as possible during the time we have left
